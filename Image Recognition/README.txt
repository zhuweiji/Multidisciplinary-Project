
do pip install -r requirements.txt to install dependencies

MainModule.py is not needed anymore for now


Just run detect_V2 to perform inference/predictions 

Run this in command prompt to run detect_V2.py
python C:\Users\micha\OneDrive\Desktop\PRED\content\PRED\detect_V2.py 

If might not work cos you'll need to configure the file paths to your own, you can do so by editing the detect_V2.py in some IDE
